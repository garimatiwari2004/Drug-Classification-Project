# Drug-Classification-Project
The dataset contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. Machine learning model is needed in order to predict the outcome of the drugs type that might be suitable for the patient.

Following steps are followed in order to predict and amplify model's accuracy=

# Importing all the libraries
The libraries I used include- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn etc.
     
# Reading the dataset
The data is "drug200.csv" which has been imported from kaggle. The data is further cleaned using various methods

# EDA- Exploratory Data Analysis which involves converting the categorical label values in numerical label values
Here I have used LabelEncoder to conver all the categorical values into the numerical values in order to carry out the processing by machine learning models

# Data visualisation with the help of Matplotlib and seaborn libraries of Python
I have tried to visualise the data usig pie chart, histograms and scatter plots.
Along with this I have also tried to find meaningful insights to carry out the furrther process.

# Choosing the right model for the classification

It's very important to choose a model wisely and improve it for better insights. I conducted experiments on training data using various classification models and tested these on the test data
Here is the different kinds of models I used in my project- SVM , Decision tree, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and K-Neighbours
And finally I compared the accuracy score of all these models to seee which on performs better.
